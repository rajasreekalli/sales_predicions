Attached the data visualization for the Sales predictions.

The following is an analysis of trends in sales data and how we can use these trends in sales to better predict and optimize future business decisions. As I find new things I am interested in further exploring I will continue to add on and organize my findings accordingly

The slides have visuals and descriptions of the most relevant figures. Of most important note as a brief summary

Sales per year over the past 25 years have mostly been steady
The most common range of outlet sales for stores on average is between $1000-2000 per day
Retail price is highest for seafood and alot of starch and fast food surprisingly.
Medium size outlets tend to produce the most sales
There is no real trend between the most visible items at stores and those that produce the most sales/have a certain mean retail price(MRP)
