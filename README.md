Sales per year over the past 25 years have mostly been steady
The most common range of outlet sales for stores on average is between $1000-2000 per day
We need to focus on the Grocery store types to improve the sales by providing the similar type of resources like the high sales Type.
Bases in the given data the Household and Groceries (Fruits and Vegetables) Types are having good number of sales where as the ‘Others’ and ‘Seafood’ types are pretty low in all outlets.
Visibility is critical on to increase/balance our sales on each item.
If any item is not marked clearly or not an easy way to locate them, customer may lose patience and skip buying that product or item.
Based on the visibility data, most of Item’s visibility is good, however we should push more on the “Others” item type along with “Health and Hygiene which can improve our sales.
Our sales are also pretty good on ”Household” and “Food and Vegetable” item types, we should consider to have them more visibility to the customers which can bump our sales on these items.
